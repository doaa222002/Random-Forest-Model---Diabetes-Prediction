# Random-Forest-Model---Diabetes-Prediction
This project applies multiple machine learning models, including Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes, to predict diabetes outcomes based on patient data. Feature selection is used to improve model accuracy, with Random Forest providing robust, ensemble-based predictions for better classification performance.
